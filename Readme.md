# Productivity App

This productivity App will help you track all your hard work and visually show what work needs to be done.

## Usage

Whenever a task is done, you can simply drag and drop any item on the respective column

The Add Item button will help you create new tasks and you can simply delete them with your keyboard in order to erase it.

## Tools Used

I learned how to use the HTML editable selectors in order to make this work, there may be some issues however so far i havent detected them. let me know if you find one to fix it. Local storage will be available so you can use this app, close it and it will be waiting for you on your machine.
